# gif3d

***WARNING*** very shaky seizure causing gif (apparently drones like to shake).

An experiment to make 3D VR gifs.

Uses [gif.js](https://github.com/jnordberg/gif.js), [three.js](http://threejs.org/), and GLGif(https://github.com/JordiRos/GLGif) to render a
360 gif with controls. **Only works in firefox**

Eventually hook up controls to WebVR (https://github.com/MozVR/vr-web-examples).

## Setup
Make sure you have bower, `npm install -g bower`
1. `bower install`
2. Then open up index.html and play around

TODO:
* use [WebVR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API) for fov and move camera
* pretty up
